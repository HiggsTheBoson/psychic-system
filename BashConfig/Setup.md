create a place to hold github repos

clone github repo psychic-system

Most Terminal programs have "ok" default fonts. I like to use ones that have ligitures like Fira Code, or Cascadia Code. If RedHat or IBM Plex turn out to support ligs Id love to use them since they are so clean and fresh
install some good fonts to make your life easier and more beautiful 

Donload and install Starship https://github.com/starship/
